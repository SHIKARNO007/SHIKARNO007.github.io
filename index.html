    <li><font size="5" color="" face=""><p>One day at school in physical education class, I mixed up my shoes and went out to play in women's sneakers. Then the eyes of all the disciples fell on mean. And it was weird.Once something happened to the shoes and I had to play basketball in socks.It was even stranger."Everyone is in sneakers and I'm in socks."
    </p></font></li>
    <li><font size="5" color="" face=""><p>Recently I was pranked. We were getting ready for tomorrow. The prank consisted in the fact that I asked the group "what time I have to come to the university tomorrow" they answered me at 8 am and I believed, but we had online training that day. It seems that prank is not very scary, but the fact is that it is 9 kilometers from my house to the university. And by the way, they didn’t let me go inside the university, it was a double knockout. But there was another reason for this. Something like this.
    </p></font></li>
    <li><font size="5" color="" face=""><p>I studied at school perfectly. And the second fail happened during my 9th grade prom speech. The point was that the speakers had not prepared their speeches, we did not know that we would speak on behalf of all 9th graders. We were told about this after the graduation concert began. I was at a loss and said what came into my head. It seems that this evening was remembered by many for a long time.
    </p></font></li>
    <li><font size="5" color="" face=""><p>A friend called me to his birthday and until everyone came I decided to go to the toilet. Later, when the guys came out, they looked at me and laughed and for a long time I could not understand why, it turned out that I went into the women's part of the restroom. After that, I look very closely at the signs at the entrance to the toilet. It's good that then there was no one inside.
    </p></font></li>
    <li><font size="5" color="" face=""><p>Every summer I went to town to see my uncle. It is very hot in summer and the only cooler in the house was the fan. Yes, yes, as you already guessed, I unexpectedly broke the only source of freshness, dropping the ventilator. It was terrible.
